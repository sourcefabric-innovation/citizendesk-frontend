  How are incoming tweet reports organised?
</h3>
<p translate>
  Reports come from Twitter in two flavours: in Monitors or in Twitter Searches
</p>
<h4 translate>
  Monitors
</h4>
<p translate>
  Monitors follow your search terms in Twitter in real time. Thus they
  will periodically show you the most recent tweets about a given
  topic. Since this may result in an huge amount of reports, we just
  support search terms with a reduced number of matches. You can
  typically use your monitor in order to follow your and other's user
  accounts.

  In order for monitors to work, you have to provide a twitter
  key. Thus every user can dispose of maximum one monitor. If you did
  not use it already, Click on your monitor in order to start the set
  up.

  Twitter searches
</h4>
<p translate>
  Twitter searches do not have the monitors limitations, but they are
  not constantly updated. They are updated just when you create them
  or visit them
